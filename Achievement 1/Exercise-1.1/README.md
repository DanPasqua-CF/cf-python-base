# Recipe App - Command Line Version

## Objective 
Build the command line version of a Recipe app, which acts as a precursor to its
web app counterpart in Achievement 2.

## Context
This project focuses on learning Python fundamentals, data structures, and object-oriented
programming. These exercises teach students how to interact with databases using Python, which is helpful 
to know when doing the same with the Django framework. The project also aims to teach standard
programming practices that will make code simpler, easier to read, and robust during execution.

### Exercise 1: Intro to Python Programming
- Install Python on macOS, Windows, or Linux
- Create and manage virtual environments
- Use pip to install and manage packages

### Exercise 2: Data Types in Python
- Use data types and methods to execute Python commands that store recipes containing their
own internal data
- Enter a number of these recipes into another linear data structure

### Exercise 3: Functions and Other Operations in Python
- Create your first script on a .py script file
- Build a script that uses if-elif-else statements, for loops, and functions to take recipes from the
user then display them

### Exercise 4: File Handling in Python
- Create a Python script that takes recipes from the user and writes the data in a binary file
- Create another script that reads the binary file and lists out the available ingredients. The user
chooses an ingredient and the script displays all recipes which contain it
- Use Python’s exception handling features to handle common errors

### Exercise 5: Object-Oriented Programming in Python
- Build a custom class for your recipes, which contains its own data attributes for name,
ingredients, cooking time, and difficulty, as well as other custom methods to interact with this
data

### Exercise 6: Connecting to Databases in Python
- Set up a MySQL database and connect your scripts to it
- Build an application that creates, reads, updates, and deletes recipes, as well as searching for
them by a single ingredient

### Exercise 7: Finalizing Your Python Program
- Use an Object Relational Mapper from SQLAlchemy to manage the contents of your database
from your application
- Build a user-friendly menu for entering and searching recipes and ingredients
- Store recipe and ingredient data in a MySQL database
- Implement recipe search according to user-defined ingredients
- Implement a detailed display of the recipe selected by the user
