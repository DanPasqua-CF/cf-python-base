# Task 1.2

## Data structure -- recipes
I chose to use a dictionary in my approach to this exercise to utilize its key/value pairing capabilities. Using a dictionary allowed me to easily store and access data. Being able to define the values I wanted to print based on the key the values were paired with made it easy to loop through and print the ingredients for each recipe.

## Data structure -- all_recipes
For ```all_recipes```, I decided to store the recipes in a list. I made this decision because I could easily handle the list values if I ever wanted to add, delete or modify any of the data. If I wanted to sort the list, then print out my recipes, I could use the ```.sort()``` function, then print out the new, ordered version of ```all_recipes```.
